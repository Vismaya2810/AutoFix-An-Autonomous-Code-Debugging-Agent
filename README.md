# AutoFix: Autonomous Code Debugging Agent
AutoFix is a rule-based autonomous debugging agent which is designed to detect runtime errors in Python code, the apply corrective fixes using excution feedback and iteratively validate the corrected code without human intervention.

## Goals:
- Execute Python code automatically
- Detect and capture runtime errors
- Classify errors using traceback analysis
- Apply rule-based fixes
- Re-run and validate corrected code
- Maintain memory of past fixes for reuse
